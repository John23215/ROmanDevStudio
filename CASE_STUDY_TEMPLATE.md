# Project Case Study Template

Use this template for each project. Strong case studies are what make a portfolio feel *real*.

## 1) Overview (1–3 sentences)
- What is the project?
- Who is it for?
- Why does it matter?

## 2) Problem (real + specific)
- What pain point did you notice?
- What were the constraints? (server size, rate limits, time, hosting, etc.)

## 3) Solution (your approach)
- What did you build?
- What decisions did you make and why?
- What tradeoffs did you choose?

## 4) Architecture (bullet list)
Example:
- Gateway events → pipeline
- Rules engine → safe actions
- Cache (Redis) → state
- DB → config + logs
- Dashboard → settings

## 5) Highlights (bullet list)
Examples:
- Permission-safe actions (no accidental staff bans)
- Anti-spam cooldowns
- Audit logs you can trust
- Configurable per server

## 6) Results (bullet list)
Don’t exaggerate. If you don’t have numbers, explain impact:
- “Staff could review incidents faster because logs were structured.”
- “Less manual moderation during spam waves.”

## 7) Next steps (bullet list)
What would you improve if you had another week/month?
